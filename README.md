This is a project I started out of the need of putting all my thoughts in one place. I aim to write song lyrics here, so I want to add a rich text editor to it. This might turn into a personal blog, where I will label the different topics I'll want to cover. I might use some tools for data/media visualization.

I chose to start a new application because I really want to keep my data safe and unreachable.

### I intend to use this app for the following topics:
* Song lyrics
* Photography
* Science
* News
* Drawings/paintings

> P.S.: This ain't the best description, I'm aware of that. I'll be updating it as advancements are made with the app to make this clear as well as keep it relevant.
